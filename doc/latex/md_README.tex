Tool to encrypt and decrypt a message withing a random graphic file (for now bitmap, propably will support jpeg and png as well)

Mainly as experiment to learn about steganography. Compiles on linux with\+: g++ -\/o stegano\+Message ./src/main.cpp \mbox{[}... all the other files located in ./src and ./header\mbox{]}

for G\+DB debugging do \+: g++ -\/o stegano\+Message ./src/main.cpp \mbox{[}... all the other files located in ./src and ./header\mbox{]}-\/export-\/dynamic -\/g

Should compile with little to no changes on M\+AC as well for now. Should work under cygwin or mingw in windows as well if needed tools are installed. No promises though.
